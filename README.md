# Dynamic Icon Component

## Overview

The Dynamic Icon Component project aims to provide a versatile solution for incorporating icons into Angular applications. Instead of relying on static icon libraries, this component allows for the dynamic rendering of icons using Angular's ngComponentOutlet directive. With this approach, developers can create separate components for each icon, allowing for flexibility in icon development and customization.

## Features

- Dynamic rendering of icons based on component-based architecture
- Support for various icon types including HTML, CSS, SVG, and IMG
- Easy addition of new icons by implementing the IDevIcon interface and adding the component to the switch statement
- Customizable icon colors through props
- Compatible with Angular applications
